When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want to share the project with other people or we want to work on project with them.
    Plus, it's like backup cloud storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you pull changes, it is better to check out what changes there are and decide what exactly
    you want to pull rather than automatically pull everything.
    If someone accidentally pushed a commit with bugs or commit that is not completed yet, in this case maybe you
    don't want to git pull these changes automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of someone's repository. You can forking only within GitHub web-site. When you are forking someone's repository
    on your GitHub page is creating a copy of that repository. After forking you can clone that repository to your local machine.
    Use forking when you want to make a copy of someone's repository on GitHub.

    Clone is a copy of your's or someone's repository from GitHub(or another place) on your local machine.
    Use cloning when you want to work with a repository on your local machine.

    Branch is a bundle of commits.
    Use branching when you want to make some experimental changes, but still want to have stable version of project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You would have a version of repository that have all latest updates.
